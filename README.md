D, Karam

Aspiring cybersecurity professional based in Canada, currently building hands-on skills through lab environments and guided learning.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Offensive security (Red Team fundamentals)
- Blue Team detection and response
- Active Directory and Windows security
- Understanding how attacks work and how they are detected

This GitHub serves as a learning portfolio documenting labs, notes, and small projects as I progress in cybersecurity.

Current Focus
- TryHackMe Premium – Beginner Path
- Linux & Windows fundamentals
- Networking and web security basics

Projects & Repositories
- TryHackMe writeups (sanitized, no flags)
- Home lab documentation
- Security notes and explanations

Goals
- Land an entry-level cybersecurity role (SOC / Security Analyst)
- Continue developing offensive security skills
- Transition into a Red Team role long-term
